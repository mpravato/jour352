      <p>Hunched over the lighting board, Jemma Lehner navigates through the lines
        of small buttons and knobs with ease. She rarely looks up from the rows,
        only to occasionally squint through her glasses at a small screen. After
        nearly 70 hours of training to be a light board operator, she says she relies
        on muscle memory to fulfill her duties for the University of Maryland’s
        production of “A Doll House.”</p>

      <p>“I was in the lighting booth every day for two weeks. I was just staring
        at that screen, listening to [the lighting designer,] and pressing the buttons he wanted,” said Lehner,
        a senior business management and dance major, after the evening’s performance.</p>

      <p>All dance and theatre majors are familiar with TDPS479: Production Practicum,
        a course that many have recently called “unfair.” Dance majors are required to
        take this course twice, and theatre majors must complete it four times. It is intended to
        provide real world experiences by allowing students to work in production shops and to
        join the backstage crew for specific productions. For one to three credits,
        students wash costumes, help build sets or assist with light and sound board operation
        among other responsibilities.</p>

      <p>Lucy Taylor, a senior theatre major, worked on the crew for “A Doll House” with Lehner.
        The pair contacted The Diamondback in February in order to voice their concerns
        about the graduation requirement. </p>

        <p>“We get the value of the work we’re doing, but expecting a fulltime student
          to work 130 hours over three weeks just isn’t fair, especially if they are self-supporting,”
          said Lehner.</p>

        <p>An article written by The Diamondback’s editor-in-chief Leah Brennan
          resulted from the pair’s efforts to share their experiences from backstage.
          They hoped it would provoke change for future students, and it brought attention
          to the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies. After its publication,
          Director Leigh Wilson Smiley enacted a four-member task force and organized an
          open-forum style meeting for students to vocalize the concerns and the benefits
          they saw in the course.</p>

        <p>According to The Diamondback, Smiley said that she was unaware of students’ issues
          before the article was published. She said that the meeting and the accompanying
          feedback were “fabulous.”</p>

        <p>Many students were passionately in favor of maintaining the structure of TDPS479.
          Senior theatre major Maria De Barros said in a Facebook post that The Diamondback’s
          reporting was “highly misinformed, subjective enough to be a narrative, and full of entitlement.”</p>

      <p>“You are gaining knowledge from working on crew if you open yourself up to it…TDPS is building your
        toolkit for having a career in the performing arts,” De Barros continued.</p>

      <p>While Smiley and other students found the conversation to be productive, Lehner said that many of her peers
        “attacked” her. Taylor said she was interrogated to the point of tears.</p>

      <p>In order to determine how the majority of students in the School of Theatre,
        Dance, and Performance Studies viewed TDPS479 as a graduation requirement,
        50 dance and theatre majors were polled.</p>

      <div class="four">

      </div>

      <p>The majority reported favorable experiences working in production shops. The average student completed 35 hours
        of work over the course of the semester. Their shifts were scheduled to fit their preexisting
        course schedules in coordination with the shop heads. </p>

      <p>Students reported that working backstage was a very different experience.</p>

      <p>Before the semester begins, everyone is emailed their assigned show’s schedule.
        Before signing a contract that obligates them to complete these hours, the School allows
        for students to submit conflicts. The hours each crew member is required to be present
        and actively working varies by position. </p>

      <p>Only six of the poll’s participants reported that their conflicts were actually excused,
        meaning that many were forced to give up work shifts and other responsibilities.
        One of the excuses was for extenuating circumstances that arose during the show’s run. </p>

      <p>“I just felt trapped,” reported Sarah Budlow, a senior dance major, in the survey.
        She fulfilled her final TDPS479 requirement on the “Noises Off” wardrobe crew by doing laundry,
        helping with minor sewing work and steaming costumes during her normal five-hour day.
        At most, students reported spending 14 hours in The Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in a day.</p>

      <p>Students who worked under the costume department as members of backstage crews reported having the most
        “leisure time” during their shifts, but were also the most frustrated by the TDPS479 requirements.
        Taylor reported doing an average of two hours of work per shift as a “dresser,” which left her a
        frustrating amount of downtime.</p>

      <p>“[They disguise it like] we’re getting all this experience, and to me, it just doesn’t feel like that,”
        said Taylor to The Diamondback in Brennan’s article.</p>

      <p>The majority of students agreed that TDPS479 credit for backstage work did not accurately represent the
        hours of work they completed. However, the majority also agreed that the hours of work should not change.
        Instead, students preferred to see the number of credit hours increase and a better accommodation for work
        conflicts.</p>

      <p>While the School was planning to begin enacting changes for the crews assigned to shows at the end of April,
        the University’s switch to remote learning is delaying these plans. All students enrolled in TDPS479 this
        semester will receive a Pass Grade (P) regardless of the number of work hours they completed.</p>

      <p>“I just want to see change, even though I’m graduating. We should not forget that we are all passionate
        and still want to get as much experience as possible,” said Lehner.</p>
