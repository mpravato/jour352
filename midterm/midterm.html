        <p>Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared
            the cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,”
            according to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically,
            the vault and gable of the north transept were of concern.
            Inspectors are also worried about structural damage that may be hidden.</p>

        <p>Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture
            with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in structural
            engineering, said the transept is probably the greatest vulnerability.
            To ensure the structure is stable, additional shoring may be necessary
            after the full extent of the damage is assessed.</p>

        <p>Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is
            susceptible to damage from heat and water.</p>

        <blockquote>“There may have been some damage to the stone, even the places that currently appear to be intact . . .
            because of the weaknesses of the material,” Martini said. “That’s a big unknown. . . .
            I don’t think anybody knows the extent of that damage.”</blockquote>

        <p>French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre Dame
            within five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical that
            timeline will be met, even with the number of resources being promised for
            restoration. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/16/yesterday-notre-dame-burned-today-people-around-world-raised-millions-rebuild" target="_blank">
            Hundreds of millions of dollars</a> have already been pledged for
            the rebuilding efforts.</p>

        <p>How the cathedral will be restored is also up for debate. On Wednesday,
            Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/notre-dame-fire-updates/2019/04/17/00dbbd84-6091-11e9-bf24-db4b9fb62aa2_story.html" target="_blank">

            <h2 class="subhead">The Notre Dame's Damage is a Cultural Loss</h2>
            <!--This is the beginning of the second "section" of the article after the subhead. -->
            <p>Notre Dame is of geographic and cultural importance to Paris. It sits
                purposefully near the center of the city on a small island surrounded by
                the Seine River. It is also the landmark next to which all other Parisian
                monuments are measured.</p>

            <p>Martin Moeller, senior curator for the National Building Museum in Washington,
                said it is not coincidental that Notre Dame is one of the most famous Gothic
                churches. “The plaza in front of the cathedral was built specifically to give a
                good viewing point,” he said. “It's not an accident that so many people have
                taken photographs of the front of the church.”</p>

        <p>There is already a debate brewing about how the church should be restored.
            Whether the efforts will include building materials similar to destroyed in
            the fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion once officials
            fully assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="glasstext">
            <p>Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames. The cathedral’s large
                stained-glass windows appear to be undamaged, and there’s a strong case for
                restoring the famed structure as closely as possible to its former glory.</p>

            <p>Even the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-cathedral-notre-dame-de-paris/" target="_blank">
                offered assistance</a> in the rehabilitation of the cathedral.</p>
        </div>

        <p>While Notre Dame is revered around the world, Moeller stressed the importance of considering how other catastrophic fires of major landmarks are handled.</p>

        <p>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bells-of-french-cathedrals-ring-in-tribute-to-notre-dame/2019/04/17/3ef7a78e-6179-11e9-bf24-db4b9fb62aa2_story.html?arc404=true" target="_blank" class="inter">

        <p>In St. Landry Parish, La., three black churches burned down from arson
            within 10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe
            for the churches had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a
            Twitter campaign urged people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst the
            devastation of Notre Dame, the total skyrocketed to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/17/after-notre-dame-fire-gofundme-ensured-black-churches-burned-louisiana-got-million-too/" target="_blank">$1 million</a>
            by Wednesday.</p>

        <p>“Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said of Notre Dame.
            “But we want to make sure that people remember that there are other buildings that are
            important to other communities. It may not be as famous, but when tragedy strikes there
            it can be devastating to a particular community or a particular group of people, and
            sometimes it doesn't get the attention it deserves.”</p>
